Note:  

- Change the information in the yaml header above:  title, author, data.
- Make sure output is html_document.
- Once you are finished coding, **run each chunk individually to make sure there are no errors**.  (If necessary fix your code.) Once your code is error-free, click "knit" on the menu above. Your document should compile to HTML, provided that you have output set to "html_document."
- In the code chunk above ("setup") echo is set to TRUE.  This means that the code in your chunks will be displayed, along with the results, in your compiled document.
- Please delete these and other directions before compiling and submitting your assignment.

## Load packages and data

```{r}
# Load packages
library(tidyverse) 

# Load data
d <- read_csv("flight_delay_clean.csv")

# Inspect data
glimpse(d)
summary(d)

```

The dataset has been cleaned for you and is ready for analysis.

## Questions

Lightly comment your code and use pipes for readability.

Comment briefly on each of the questions, as directed.  Only the the final question requires a lengthier response.

### Q1

Compute the mean, median, 90th percentile, and standard deviation of arrival delay minutes for RegionEx flights. Do the same for MDA flights. Which measure of central tendency would be most appropriate for comparing airline performance?

```{r}

```

> 

### Q2

Inspect the distribution of RegionEx's arrival delays by constructing a histogram of the number of arrival delay minutes of RegionEx's flights. Do the same for MDA's flights. How do these two distributions compare? Hint:  use facet_wrap().

```{r}

```

> 

### Q3

So far we have considered airline performance in terms of average delay in minutes.  However, the performance metrics, as noted in the case description, also include the percentage of delayed flights.  Let's verify that MDA's COO is correct: does RegionEx have a higher percentage of delayed flights?

Here is code to answer that question:

```{r}
# Create a summary table of percent delayed by airline.
d %>% 
  group_by(airline) %>% 
  summarize(n = n(),
            percent_delay = (mean(delay_indicator) * 100) %>% round(1)) 

```

Note that because `delay_indicator` is numeric (a binary 0/1 variable) calculating the mean of the vector returns the proportion of 1s, which, multiplied by 100, is equivalent to the *percentage* of delayed flights.

Write your own code to create a table summarizing the percentage of delayed flights by airline *and route.*  

```{r}

```

These tables contain conflicting information. How should you answer the question of whether RegionEx has a higher percentage of delayed flights?  Is the the COO correct?  And, if not, why not?

> 

### Q4

Compare the scheduled flight durations for the two airlines on each of their four routes. Compare the actual flight durations. What do you notice? If the two airlines had the same scheduled duration, what impact would this have on their delay records?

```{r}

```

> 

## Q5

Does the data support the claim that the on‐time performance of RegionEx is worse than that of MDA? Write a paragraph in which you argue a position. In your answer, please incorporate the quantitative evidence you have developed above.
